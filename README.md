# 🧵 Python NumPy – Reshaping & Flattening

This repository is a structured guide to mastering **NumPy reshaping** and **flattening vs ravel concepts**, which are essential for efficient data handling and memory management in Python.  
It features practical tasks covering reshaping arrays into different dimensions, and understanding the differences between flattening (copy) vs ravel (view). Perfect for beginners who want clarity on array transformation operations.
